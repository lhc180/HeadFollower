Welcome to the source repository of the PoCoMo project

High level details: http://fluid.media.mit.edu/people/roy/current/pocomo.html

Prerequisites:
- OpenCV 2.3, compiled for Android: http://opencv.willowgarage.com/wiki/Android
- Android-OpenCV, which is shipped with the OpenCV trunk, but needs to be built manually
- CMake


To build (very very roughly):
- Open Eclipse
- Create a project from existing source, using this directory
- Run ./cmake_run_from_build.sh, this will create, god willing, the lib*.so file needed for running (all JNI calls)
- Run via eclipse
