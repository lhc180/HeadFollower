Welcome to the source repository of the PoCoMo project

High level details: http://fluid.media.mit.edu/people/roy/current/pocomo.html

Prerequisites:
- OpenCV 2.3, compiled for Android: http://opencv.willowgarage.com/wiki/Android
- Android-OpenCV, which is shipped with the OpenCV trunk, but needs to be built manually
- CMake


To build (very very roughly):
- Open Eclipse
- Create a project from existing source, using this directory
- Run ./cmake_run_from_build.sh, this will create, god willing, the lib*.so file needed for running (all JNI calls)
- Run via eclipse


Note: I am doing my best to move the old codebase into the opensource version of PoCoMo. This means that not all the features mentioned in the paper are implemented yet in this version. Please hang on, as I believe around October there will be another big push. Thanks! Roy.

To build and run the PC application for testing the tracking algorithm:
cd jni/PCOpenCVTest
cmake . ; make
./HeadFollower-PCTest
